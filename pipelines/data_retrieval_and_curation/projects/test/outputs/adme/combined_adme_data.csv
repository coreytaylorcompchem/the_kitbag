The hepatocytes are diluted to a concentration of 0.5x1E6 cells /mL and equilibrated at 37 C. Biotransformation is initiated by addition of compound and mixing. Standard time-points are used as 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 min, and the final solvent concentrations are 0.99 % methanol and 0.01 % DMSO. At each specified time-point, a sample aliquot is removed from the test incubation mixture and combined into a cassette of up to 4 compounds, in methanol containing internal standards (Dextromethorphan, Diazepam, Midazolam, Phenacetin and Naloxone) to stop the reaction. The quenched samples are then centrifuged to precipitate the protein. The supernatants are analyzed by LC-MS/MS to measure the test parent compound remaining at each time-point.
